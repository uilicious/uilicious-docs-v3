# Close Tab

### `I.closeTab` <a href="#iclosetab" id="iclosetab"></a>

Close the current tab.

`I.closeTab` cannot be used if there's only one tab open.

After the tab is closed, the browser will be automatically switched to the next tab (or the last tab if the closed tab was the last).

#### Usage <a href="#usage" id="usage"></a>

```javascript
I.closeTab()
```
