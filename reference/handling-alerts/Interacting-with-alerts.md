# Interacting with Alerts

**Please take note:**

* Browser support:
  * Fully supported on Chrome and Microsoft Edge
  * Unstable on Firefox, Safari, and IE11 - work in progress to fully support alerts
* Current limitations:
  * **Screenshots are disabled when alerts are open**. We're working on enabling screenshots during alert. Vote on [this ticket](https://trello.com/c/AdVKnK0x) if you require this feature to bump it up our priority list.
