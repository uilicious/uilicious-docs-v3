# Share Test Reports

Once youâ€™ve tested your scripts, you may want to create and share your reports of previous test runs with your team. This section will cover creating and sharing detailed test reports with others.

**There are three ways to share a report:**

* Share a Link
* Share Embed
* Download the Test Report

### View Previous Test Runs

First, click the **Runs** pane in the UIlicious Editor.

There are two ways to view all previous Test Runs: **panel view** or **list view**.

This guide will focus on using the **panel view** to view previous test runs and create our test report.

In the **Runs** pane, you are able to narrow down the list of tests available to you by selecting the **Status**, **Test**, **Date Range**, **Browser**, **Resolution**, and **Trigger**.

**Triggers** indicates if the Test Run was Manual (run by you in the Editor), Job (scheduled), or CLI (produced via the Command Line Interface).
