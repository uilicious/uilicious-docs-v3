# How to Set Up Notifications

## Introduction

When scheduling an automated job, you also can be notified about the results of your test runs through [email alerts](../schedule-an-automated-job/set-up-email-notifications.md) or by setting up alerts on your communication platforms using webhooks.

We currently support the following communication platforms:

* [Slack](../schedule-an-automated-job/set-up-slack-notifications.md)
* [Microsoft Teams](../schedule-an-automated-job/set-up-teams-notifications.md)
* [Discord](set-up-discord-notifications.md)
* [Telegram](../schedule-an-automated-job/set-up-teams-notifications.md)
