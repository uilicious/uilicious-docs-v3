# Schedule a Job

## Introduction

Monitoring is creating a job to automatically run tests on a scheduled basis. You can schedule your tests to run at set intervals or at specific times.

There are two main ways to schedule automated test jobs in UIlicious: the UIlicious editor or the monitoring panel of the UIlicious editor. The Monitoring panel displays all scheduled jobs in one place.

You can select a single test or run tests in bulk in either approach.

There are also several options to configure in testing:

* Dataset
* Browser Type
* Resolution
* User Agent

Once you have created and scheduled a job, you can configure them to send instant notifications when automated tests fail or produce an error.

In this section, we will learn how to:

* [Create a scheduled job ](./#schedule-a-job)
* [Delete a job](./#how-to-delete-a-job)
* [Disable a job](./#how-to-disable-a-job)
* [Check Job Status](./#view-status-of-a-job)

If you are interested in setting up notifications to receive status updates about your scheduled job, check out our [How to Set Up Notifications](./set-up-notifications.md) section.
