# Setup Notifications

## Introduction

When scheduling an automated job, you also can be notified about the results of your test runs through [email alerts](set-up-email-notifications.md) or by setting up alerts on your communication platforms using webhooks.

We currently support the following communication platforms:

* [Slack](set-up-slack-notifications.md)
* [Microsoft Teams](set-up-microsoft-teams-notifications.md)
* [Discord](set-up-discord-notifications.md)
* [Telegram](set-up-microsoft-teams-notifications.md)
