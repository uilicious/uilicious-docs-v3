# Setup a notification

## Introduction

When scheduling an automated job, you also can be notified about the results of your test runs through [email alerts](./set-up-email-notifications) or by setting up alerts on your communication platforms using webhooks.

We currently support the following communication platforms:

- [Slack](./set-up-slack-notifications)
- [Discord](./set-up-discord-notifications)
- [Telegram](./set-up-telegram-notifications)
